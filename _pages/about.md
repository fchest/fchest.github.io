I received the Ph.D degree with the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Beijing, China, in 2021, and the B.S. degree from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT), Beijing, China, in 2016. I am currently an associate professor with the School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Heifei, China. My current research interests include brain-computer interface and speech processing.

My research interests include:
---

* Speech Processing (Speech Enhancement and Separation, ASR, Fake Speech Detection)

* Brain-Computer Interface (Auditory Attention Decoding, Emotion Recognition, Motor Imagery)
